This is the GCC-1750 math library. It is based on the text by
Cody and Waite, with additional functions specially written for 
the 1750.

Installation
------------
The header file, math.h, should be installed in a target-dependent
location. On BSD-like Unix systems, this is usually:

	/usr/local/m1750-coff/include/

The path '/usr/local/' is referred to as the 'prefix' in the make
file, and you will nedd to edit the definition of prefix for
other kinds of Unix.

The two library files, libm.a and libmx.a, must be installed in
the general binary directory. Where the prefix is /usr/local then
the binary directory is:

        /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/m1750-coff/2.7.2/

To build the libaries, just type 'make'.

To install the libraries, check the prefix is correct then type
'make install'. You may need special privilege to do this.

 
Accuracy
--------
On the whole the accuracy is good. If you have the libm test suite, 
then you can test the root means square accuracy using the tests provided. 
Change to the tests directory then type 'make run'.

For a better idea of accuracy, look in the directory 'graphs'. There you
will find test programs that generate data files for plotting. You can
use a program such as 'gnuplot'.

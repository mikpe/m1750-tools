INSTALLTION INSTRUCTIONS
========================

The directory tree contains the source for the GCC-1750 C library.

To build the object code libraries, use the make command as follows:

$ make

To install the object code libraries, use make with the target 'install'
You will probably need root privilege to do the installation. You may need
to specifiy a prefix. On BSD-style Unix systems, the prefix is /usr/local.
On Solaris it is /opt/gnu.

$make install prefix=/opt/gnu

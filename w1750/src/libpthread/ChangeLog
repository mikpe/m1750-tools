	* pthread_internals.h: Added code to set and clear _enbl to the
	definitions for INTERRUPT_ENABLE and INTERRUPT_DISABLE. This will
	allow the expanded memory call/return mechanism to work with
	interrupts disabled, as in the pthread kernel.
	
	* pthread_create.c: (pthread_body) Added expanded memory case 
	to the code that calls the body.

	*intwait.c: (intwait_handler) Made the handler function 
	external so that the compiler generates a long return.

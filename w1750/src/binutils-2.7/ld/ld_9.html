Unless quoted, symbol names start with a letter, underscore, or point
and may include any letters, underscores, digits, points,
and hyphens.  Unquoted symbol names must not conflict with any
keywords.  You can specify a symbol which contains odd characters or has
the same name as a keyword, by surrounding the symbol name in double quotes:

<PRE>
        "SECTION" = 9;
        "with a space" = "also with a space" + 10;
</PRE>

<P>
Since symbols can contain many non-alphabetic characters, it is safest
to delimit symbols with spaces.  For example, <SAMP>`A-B'</SAMP> is one symbol,
whereas <SAMP>`A - B'</SAMP> is an expression involving subtraction.

You may create global symbols, and assign values (addresses) to global
symbols, using any of the C assignment operators:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR>  = <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> &#38;= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> += <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> -= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> *= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> /= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
</DL>

<P>
Two things distinguish assignment from other operators in <CODE>ld</CODE>
expressions.

<UL>
<LI>

Assignment may only be used at the root of an expression;
<SAMP>`a=b+3;'</SAMP> is allowed, but <SAMP>`a+b=3;'</SAMP> is an error.

<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<LI>

You must place a trailing semicolon ("<KBD>;</KBD>") at the end of an
assignment statement.
</UL>

<P>
Assignment statements may appear:

<UL>
<LI>

as commands in their own right in an <CODE>ld</CODE> script; or
<LI>

as independent statements within a <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command; or
<LI>

as part of the contents of a section definition in a
<CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command.
</UL>

<P>
The first two cases are equivalent in effect--both define a symbol with
an absolute address.  The last case defines a symbol whose address is
relative to a particular section (see section <A HREF="ld_17.html#SEC17">Specifying Output Sections</A>).

</P>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
When a linker expression is evaluated and assigned to a variable, it is
given either an absolute or a relocatable type. An absolute expression
type is one in which the symbol contains the value that it will have in
the output file; a relocatable expression type is one in which the
value is expressed as a fixed offset from the base of a section.

</P>
<P>
The type of the expression is controlled by its position in the script
file.  A symbol assigned within a section definition is created relative
to the base of the section; a symbol assigned in any other place is
created as an absolute symbol. Since a symbol created within a
section definition is relative to the base of the section, it
will remain relocatable if relocatable output is requested.  A symbol
may be created with an absolute value even when assigned to within a
section definition by using the absolute assignment function
<CODE>ABSOLUTE</CODE>.  For example, to create an absolute symbol whose address
is the last byte of an output section named <CODE>.data</CODE>:

<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .data : 
    {
      *(.data)
      _edata = ABSOLUTE(.) ;
    } 
... }
</PRE>

<P>
The linker tries to put off the evaluation of an assignment until all
the terms in the source expression are known (see section <A HREF="ld_12.html#SEC12">Evaluation</A>).  For
instance, the sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation,
so assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after
allocation. Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location
counter <STRONG>dot</STRONG>, <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> must be evaluated during allocation. If the
result of an expression is required, but the value is not available,
then an error results.  For example, a script like the following

<PRE>
SECTIONS { ...
  text 9+this_isnt_constant : 
    { ...
    }
... }
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
will cause the error message "<CODE>Non constant expression for initial
address</CODE>".

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
In some cases, it is desirable for a linker script to define a symbol
only if it is referenced, and only if it is not defined by any object
included in the link.  For example, traditional linkers defined the
symbol <SAMP>`etext'</SAMP>.  However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to
use <SAMP>`etext'</SAMP> as a function name without encountering an error.
The <CODE>PROVIDE</CODE> keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as
<SAMP>`etext'</SAMP>, only if it is referenced but not defined.  The syntax is
<CODE>PROVIDE(<VAR>symbol</VAR> = <VAR>expression</VAR>)</CODE>.

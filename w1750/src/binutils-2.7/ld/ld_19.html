In a section definition, you can specify the contents of an output
section by listing particular input files, by listing particular
input-file sections, or by a combination of the two.  You can also place
arbitrary data in the section, and define symbols relative to the
beginning of the section.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>contents</VAR> of a section definition may include any of the
following kinds of statement.  You can include as many of these as you
like in a single section definition, separated from one another by
whitespace. 

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX254"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX255"></A>
 
You may simply name a particular input file to be placed in the current
output section; <EM>all</EM> sections from that file are placed in the
current section definition.  If the file name has already been mentioned
in another section definition, with an explicit section name list, then
only those sections which have not yet been allocated are used.

To specify a list of particular files by name:

<PRE>
.data : { afile.o bfile.o cfile.o }
</PRE>

The example also illustrates that multiple statements can be included in
the contents of a section definition, since each file name is a separate
statement. 

<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>( <VAR>section</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>( <VAR>section</VAR> , <VAR>section</VAR>, ... )</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>( <VAR>section</VAR> <VAR>section</VAR> ... )</CODE>
<DD>
You can name one or more sections from your input files, for
insertion in the current output section.  If you wish to specify a list
of input-file sections inside the parentheses, you may separate the
section names by either commas or whitespace.

<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
<A NAME="IDX259"></A>
<DT><CODE>* (<VAR>section</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>* (<VAR>section</VAR>, <VAR>section</VAR>, ...)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>* (<VAR>section</VAR> <VAR>section</VAR> ...)</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of explicitly naming particular input files in a link control
script, you can refer to <EM>all</EM> files from the <CODE>ld</CODE> command
line: use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> instead of a particular file name before the
parenthesized input-file section list.  

If you have already explicitly included some files by name, <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
refers to all <EM>remaining</EM> files--those whose places in the output
file have not yet been defined.

For example, to copy sections <CODE>1</CODE> through <CODE>4</CODE> from an Oasys file
into the <CODE>.text</CODE> section of an <CODE>a.out</CODE> file, and sections <CODE>13</CODE>
and <CODE>14</CODE> into the <CODE>.data</CODE> section:

<PRE>
SECTIONS {
  .text :{
    *("1" "2" "3" "4")
  }
  
  .data :{
    *("13" "14")
  }
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX260"></A>
<SAMP>`[ <VAR>section</VAR> ... ]'</SAMP> used to be accepted as an alternate way
to specify named sections from all unallocated input files.  Because
some operating systems (VMS) allow brackets in file names, that notation
is no longer supported.

<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR><CODE>( COMMON )</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>*( COMMON )</CODE>
<DD>
Specify where in your output file to place uninitialized data
with this notation.  <CODE>*(COMMON)</CODE> by itself refers to all
uninitialized data from all input files (so far as it is not yet
allocated); <VAR>filename</VAR><CODE>(COMMON)</CODE> refers to uninitialized data
from a particular file.  Both are special cases of the general
mechanisms for specifying where to place input-file sections:
<CODE>ld</CODE> permits you to refer to uninitialized data as if it
were in an input-file section named <CODE>COMMON</CODE>, regardless of the
input file's format.
</DL>

<P>
For example, the following command script arranges the output file into
three consecutive sections, named <CODE>.text</CODE>, <CODE>.data</CODE>, and
<CODE>.bss</CODE>, taking the input for each from the correspondingly named
sections of all the input files:

</P>

<PRE>
SECTIONS { 
  .text : { *(.text) }
  .data : { *(.data) } 
  .bss :  { *(.bss)  *(COMMON) } 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The following example reads all of the sections from file <CODE>all.o</CODE>
and places them at the start of output section <CODE>outputa</CODE> which
starts at location <CODE>0x10000</CODE>. All of section <CODE>.input1</CODE> from
file <CODE>foo.o</CODE> follows immediately, in the same output section.  All
of section <CODE>.input2</CODE> from <CODE>foo.o</CODE> goes into output section
<CODE>outputb</CODE>, followed by section <CODE>.input1</CODE> from <CODE>foo1.o</CODE>.
All of the remaining <CODE>.input1</CODE> and <CODE>.input2</CODE> sections from any
files are written to output section <CODE>outputc</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
SECTIONS {
  outputa 0x10000 :
    {
    all.o
    foo.o (.input1)
    }
  outputb :
    {
    foo.o (.input2)
    foo1.o (.input1)
    }
  outputc :
    {
    *(.input1)
    *(.input2)
    }
}

<P>

The most frequently used statement in the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command is
the <STRONG>section definition</STRONG>, which specifies the
properties of an output section: its location, alignment, contents,
fill pattern, and target memory region.  Most of
these specifications are optional; the simplest form of a section
definition is

<PRE>
SECTIONS { ...
  <VAR>secname</VAR> : {
    <VAR>contents</VAR>
  }
... }
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<VAR>secname</VAR> is the name of the output section, and <VAR>contents</VAR> a
specification of what goes there--for example, a list of input files or
sections of input files (see section <A HREF="ld_19.html#SEC19">Section Placement</A>).  As you might
assume, the whitespace shown is optional.  You do need the colon
<SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and the braces <SAMP>`{}'</SAMP>, however.

</P>
<P>
<VAR>secname</VAR> must meet the constraints of your output format.  In
formats which only support a limited number of sections, such as
<CODE>a.out</CODE>, the name must be one of the names supported by the format
(<CODE>a.out</CODE>, for example, allows only <CODE>.text</CODE>, <CODE>.data</CODE> or
<CODE>.bss</CODE>). If the output format supports any number of sections, but
with numbers and not names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be
supplied as a quoted numeric string.  A section name may consist of any
sequence of characters, but any name which does not conform to the standard
<CODE>ld</CODE> symbol name syntax must be quoted.
See section <A HREF="ld_9.html#SEC9">Symbol Names</A>.

</P>
<P>
The special <VAR>secname</VAR> <SAMP>`/DISCARD/'</SAMP> may be used to discard input
sections.  Any sections which are assigned to an output section named
<SAMP>`/DISCARD/'</SAMP> are not included in the final link output.

</P>
<P>
The linker will not create output sections which do not have any
contents.  This is for convenience when referring to input sections that
may or may not exist.  For example,

<PRE>
.foo { *(.foo) }
</PRE>

<P>
will only create a <SAMP>`.foo'</SAMP> section in the output file if there is a
<SAMP>`.foo'</SAMP> section in at least one input file.

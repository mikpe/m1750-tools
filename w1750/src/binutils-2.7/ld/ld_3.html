<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC5">Command Language</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
The command language provides explicit control over the link process,
allowing complete specification of the mapping between the linker's
input files and its output.  It controls:

<UL>
<LI>

input files 
<LI>

file formats
<LI>

output file layout
<LI>

addresses of sections
<LI>

placement of common blocks
</UL>

<P>
You may supply a command file (also known as a link script) to the
linker either explicitly through the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option, or implicitly as
an ordinary file. If the linker opens a file which it cannot recognize
as a supported object or archive format, it reports an error.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC6">Linker Scripts</A></H2>
<P>
The <CODE>ld</CODE> command language is a collection of statements; some are
simple keywords setting a particular option, some are used to select and
group input files or name output files; and two statement
types have a fundamental and pervasive impact on the linking process.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
The most fundamental command of the <CODE>ld</CODE> command language is the
<CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC17">Specifying Output Sections</A>).  Every meaningful command
script must have a <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command: it specifies a
"picture" of the output file's layout, in varying degrees of detail.
No other command is required in all cases.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command complements <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> by describing the
available memory in the target architecture.  This command is optional;
if you don't use a <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command, <CODE>ld</CODE> assumes sufficient
memory is available in a contiguous block for all output.
See section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC16">Memory Layout</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
You may include comments in linker scripts just as in C: delimited
by <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`*/'</SAMP>.  As in C, comments are syntactically
equivalent to whitespace.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC7">Expressions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
Many useful commands involve arithmetic expressions.  The syntax for
expressions in the command language is identical to that of C
expressions, with the following features:

<UL>
<LI>

All expressions evaluated as integers and
are of "long" or "unsigned long" type.
<LI>

All constants are integers.
<LI>

All of the C arithmetic operators are provided.
<LI>

You may reference, define, and create global variables.
<LI>

You may call special purpose built-in functions.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC8">Integers</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
An octal integer is <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> followed by zero or more of the octal
digits (<SAMP>`01234567'</SAMP>).

<PRE>
_as_octal = 0157255;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (<SAMP>`0123456789'</SAMP>).

<PRE>
_as_decimal = 57005;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
A hexadecimal integer is <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`0X'</SAMP> followed by one or
more hexadecimal digits chosen from <SAMP>`0123456789abcdefABCDEF'</SAMP>.

<PRE>
_as_hex = 0xdead;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
To write a negative integer, use
the prefix operator <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC11">Operators</A>).

<PRE>
_as_neg = -57005;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
Additionally the suffixes <CODE>K</CODE> and <CODE>M</CODE> may be used to scale a
constant by 
respectively. For example, the following all refer to the same quantity:

</P>

<PRE>
        _fourk_1 = 4K;
        _fourk_2 = 4096;
        _fourk_3 = 0x1000;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC9">Symbol Names</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
Unless quoted, symbol names start with a letter, underscore, or point
and may include any letters, underscores, digits, points,
and hyphens.  Unquoted symbol names must not conflict with any
keywords.  You can specify a symbol which contains odd characters or has
the same name as a keyword, by surrounding the symbol name in double quotes:

<PRE>
        "SECTION" = 9;
        "with a space" = "also with a space" + 10;
</PRE>

<P>
Since symbols can contain many non-alphabetic characters, it is safest
to delimit symbols with spaces.  For example, <SAMP>`A-B'</SAMP> is one symbol,
whereas <SAMP>`A - B'</SAMP> is an expression involving subtraction.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC10">The Location Counter</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
The special linker variable <STRONG>dot</STRONG> <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> always contains the
current output location counter. Since the <CODE>.</CODE> always refers to
a location in an output section, it must always appear in an
expression within a <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command. The <CODE>.</CODE> symbol
may appear anywhere that an ordinary symbol is allowed in an
expression, but its assignments have a side effect. Assigning a value
to the <CODE>.</CODE> symbol will cause the location counter to be moved.
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
This may be used to create holes in the output section.  The location
counter may never be moved backwards.

<PRE>
SECTIONS
{
  output :
  {
  file1(.text)
  . = . + 1000;
  file2(.text)
  . += 1000;
  file3(.text)
  } = 0x1234;
}
</PRE>

<P>
In the previous example, <CODE>file1</CODE> is located at the beginning of the
output section, then there is a 1000 byte gap.  Then <CODE>file2</CODE>
appears, also with a 1000 byte gap following before <CODE>file3</CODE> is
loaded.  The notation <SAMP>`= 0x1234'</SAMP> specifies what data to write in
the gaps (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC21">Optional Section Attributes</A>).

The linker recognizes  the standard C set of arithmetic operators, with
the standard bindings and precedence levels:
{
@obeylines@parskip=0pt@parindent=0pt
@dag@quad Prefix operators.
@ddag@quad See section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC13">Assignment: Defining Symbols</A>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC12">Evaluation</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
The linker uses "lazy evaluation" for expressions; it only calculates
an expression when absolutely necessary.  The linker needs the value of
the start address, and the lengths of memory regions, in order to do any
linking at all; these values are computed as soon as possible when the
linker reads in the command file.  However, other values (such as symbol
values) are not known or needed until after storage allocation.  Such
values are evaluated later, when other information (such as the sizes of
output sections) is available for use in the symbol assignment
expression.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC13">Assignment: Defining Symbols</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
You may create global symbols, and assign values (addresses) to global
symbols, using any of the C assignment operators:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR>  = <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> &#38;= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> += <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> -= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> *= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>symbol</VAR> /= <VAR>expression</VAR> ;</CODE>
<DD>
</DL>

<P>
Two things distinguish assignment from other operators in <CODE>ld</CODE>
expressions.

<UL>
<LI>

Assignment may only be used at the root of an expression;
<SAMP>`a=b+3;'</SAMP> is allowed, but <SAMP>`a+b=3;'</SAMP> is an error.

<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<LI>

You must place a trailing semicolon ("<KBD>;</KBD>") at the end of an
assignment statement.
</UL>

<P>
Assignment statements may appear:

<UL>
<LI>

as commands in their own right in an <CODE>ld</CODE> script; or
<LI>

as independent statements within a <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command; or
<LI>

as part of the contents of a section definition in a
<CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command.
</UL>

<P>
The first two cases are equivalent in effect--both define a symbol with
an absolute address.  The last case defines a symbol whose address is
relative to a particular section (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC17">Specifying Output Sections</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
When a linker expression is evaluated and assigned to a variable, it is
given either an absolute or a relocatable type. An absolute expression
type is one in which the symbol contains the value that it will have in
the output file; a relocatable expression type is one in which the
value is expressed as a fixed offset from the base of a section.

</P>
<P>
The type of the expression is controlled by its position in the script
file.  A symbol assigned within a section definition is created relative
to the base of the section; a symbol assigned in any other place is
created as an absolute symbol. Since a symbol created within a
section definition is relative to the base of the section, it
will remain relocatable if relocatable output is requested.  A symbol
may be created with an absolute value even when assigned to within a
section definition by using the absolute assignment function
<CODE>ABSOLUTE</CODE>.  For example, to create an absolute symbol whose address
is the last byte of an output section named <CODE>.data</CODE>:

<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .data : 
    {
      *(.data)
      _edata = ABSOLUTE(.) ;
    } 
... }
</PRE>

<P>
The linker tries to put off the evaluation of an assignment until all
the terms in the source expression are known (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC12">Evaluation</A>).  For
instance, the sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation,
so assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after
allocation. Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location
counter <STRONG>dot</STRONG>, <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> must be evaluated during allocation. If the
result of an expression is required, but the value is not available,
then an error results.  For example, a script like the following

<PRE>
SECTIONS { ...
  text 9+this_isnt_constant : 
    { ...
    }
... }
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
will cause the error message "<CODE>Non constant expression for initial
address</CODE>".

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
In some cases, it is desirable for a linker script to define a symbol
only if it is referenced, and only if it is not defined by any object
included in the link.  For example, traditional linkers defined the
symbol <SAMP>`etext'</SAMP>.  However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to
use <SAMP>`etext'</SAMP> as a function name without encountering an error.
The <CODE>PROVIDE</CODE> keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as
<SAMP>`etext'</SAMP>, only if it is referenced but not defined.  The syntax is
<CODE>PROVIDE(<VAR>symbol</VAR> = <VAR>expression</VAR>)</CODE>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC14">Arithmetic Functions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
The command language includes a number of built-in
functions for use in link script expressions.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ABSOLUTE(<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX223"></A>
 
Return the absolute (non-relocatable, as opposed to non-negative) value
of the expression <VAR>exp</VAR>.  Primarily useful to assign an absolute
value to a symbol within a section definition, where symbol values are
normally section-relative.

<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADDR(<VAR>section</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Return the absolute address of the named <VAR>section</VAR>.  Your script must
previously have defined the location of that section. In the following
example, <CODE>symbol_1</CODE> and <CODE>symbol_2</CODE> are assigned identical
values:

<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .output1 :
    { 
    start_of_output_1 = ABSOLUTE(.);
    ...
    }
  .output :
    {
    symbol_1 = ADDR(.output1);
    symbol_2 = start_of_output_1;
    }
... }
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
<DT><CODE>ALIGN(<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Return the result of the current location counter (<CODE>.</CODE>) aligned to
the next <VAR>exp</VAR> boundary.  <VAR>exp</VAR> must be an expression whose
value is a power of two.  This is equivalent to 

<PRE>
(. + <VAR>exp</VAR> - 1) &#38; ~(<VAR>exp</VAR> - 1)
</PRE>

<CODE>ALIGN</CODE> doesn't change the value of the location counter--it just
does arithmetic on it.  As an example, to align the output <CODE>.data</CODE>
section to the next <CODE>0x2000</CODE> byte boundary after the preceding
section and to set a variable within the section to the next
<CODE>0x8000</CODE> boundary after the input sections:

<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .data ALIGN(0x2000): {
    *(.data)
    variable = ALIGN(0x8000);
  }
... }
</PRE>

The first use of <CODE>ALIGN</CODE> in this example specifies the location of
a section because it is used as the optional <VAR>start</VAR> attribute of a
section definition (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC21">Optional Section Attributes</A>).  The second use simply
defines the value of a variable.

The built-in <CODE>NEXT</CODE> is closely related to <CODE>ALIGN</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFINED(<VAR>symbol</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Return 1 if <VAR>symbol</VAR> is in the linker global symbol table and is
defined, otherwise return 0.  You can use this function to provide default
values for symbols.  For example, the following command-file fragment shows how
to set a global symbol <CODE>begin</CODE> to the first location in the
<CODE>.text</CODE> section--but if a symbol called <CODE>begin</CODE> already
existed, its value is preserved:


<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .text : {
    begin = DEFINED(begin) ? begin : . ;
    ...
  }
... }
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
<DT><CODE>NEXT(<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Return the next unallocated address that is a multiple of <VAR>exp</VAR>.
This function is closely related to <CODE>ALIGN(<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>; unless you
use the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command to define discontinuous memory for the
output file, the two functions are equivalent.

<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
<DT><CODE>SIZEOF(<VAR>section</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Return the size in bytes of the named <VAR>section</VAR>, if that section has
been allocated.  In the following example, <CODE>symbol_1</CODE> and
<CODE>symbol_2</CODE> are assigned identical values:

<PRE>
SECTIONS{ ...
  .output {
    .start = . ;
    ...
    .end = . ;
    }
  symbol_1 = .end - .start ;
  symbol_2 = SIZEOF(.output);
... }
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<DT><CODE>SIZEOF_HEADERS</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>sizeof_headers</CODE>
<DD>
Return the size in bytes of the output file's headers.  You can use this number
as the start address of the first section, if you choose, to facilitate
paging. 

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC15">Semicolons</A></H3>

<P>
Semicolons ("<KBD>;</KBD>") are required in the following places.  In all
other places they can appear for aesthetic reasons but are otherwise ignored.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Assignment</CODE>
<DD>
Semicolons must appear at the end of assignment expressions.
See section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC13">Assignment: Defining Symbols</A>

<DT><CODE>PHDRS</CODE>
<DD>
Semicolons must appear at the end of a <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> statement.

<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
The linker's default configuration permits allocation of all available memory.
You can override this configuration by using the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command.  The
<CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command describes the location and size of blocks of
memory in the target.  By using it carefully, you can describe which
memory regions may be used by the linker, and which memory regions it
must avoid.  The linker does not shuffle sections to fit into the
available regions, but does move the requested sections into the correct
regions and issue errors when the regions become too full.  

</P>
<P>
A command file may contain at most one use of the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE>
command; however, you can define as many blocks of memory within it as
you wish.  The syntax is:
        

<PRE>
MEMORY 
  {
    <VAR>name</VAR> (<VAR>attr</VAR>) : ORIGIN = <VAR>origin</VAR>, LENGTH = <VAR>len</VAR>
    ...
  }
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
 
is a name used internally by the linker to refer to the region. Any
symbol name may be used.  The region names are stored in a separate
name space, and will not conflict with symbols, file names or section
names.  Use distinct names to specify multiple regions.

<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
<DT><CODE>(<VAR>attr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
is an optional list of attributes, permitted for compatibility with the
AT&#38;T linker but not used by <CODE>ld</CODE> beyond checking that the
attribute list is valid.  Valid attribute lists must be made up of the
characters "<CODE>LIRWX</CODE>".  If you omit the attribute list, you may
omit the parentheses around it as well.

<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>origin</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
is the start address of the region in physical memory.  It is
an expression that must evaluate to a constant before
memory allocation is performed. The keyword <CODE>ORIGIN</CODE> may be
abbreviated to <CODE>org</CODE> or <CODE>o</CODE> (but not, for example, <SAMP>`ORG'</SAMP>).

<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>len</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
is the size in bytes of the region (an expression).
The keyword <CODE>LENGTH</CODE> may be abbreviated to <CODE>len</CODE> or <CODE>l</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
For example, to specify that memory has two regions available for
allocation--one starting at 0 for 256 kilobytes, and the other
starting at <CODE>0x40000000</CODE> for four megabytes:

</P>

<PRE>
MEMORY 
  {
  rom : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 256K
  ram : org = 0x40000000, l = 4M
  }
</PRE>

<P>
Once you have defined a region of memory named <VAR>mem</VAR>, you can direct
specific output sections there by using a command ending in
<SAMP>`&#62;<VAR>mem</VAR>'</SAMP> within the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC21">Optional Section Attributes</A>).  If the combined output sections directed to a region are too
big for the region, the linker will issue an error message.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC17">Specifying Output Sections</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
The <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command controls exactly where input sections are
placed into output sections, their order in the output file, and to
which output sections they are allocated.

</P>
<P>
You may use at most one <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command in a script file,
but you can have as many statements within it as you wish.  Statements
within the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command can do one of three things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

define the entry point;

<LI>

assign a value to a symbol;

<LI>

describe the placement of a named output section, and which input
sections go into it.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the first two operations--defining the entry point and
defining symbols--outside the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command: see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC23">The Entry Point</A>, and section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC13">Assignment: Defining Symbols</A>.  They are permitted here as well for
your convenience in reading the script, so that symbols and the entry
point can be defined at meaningful points in your output-file layout.

</P>
<P>
If you do not use a <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command, the linker places each input
section into an identically named output section in the order that the
sections are first encountered in the input files.  If all input sections
are present in the first file, for example, the order of sections in the
output file will match the order in the first input file.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="ld_toc.html#TOC18">Section Definitions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
The most frequently used statement in the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command is
the <STRONG>section definition</STRONG>, which specifies the
properties of an output section: its location, alignment, contents,
fill pattern, and target memory region.  Most of
these specifications are optional; the simplest form of a section
definition is

<PRE>
SECTIONS { ...
  <VAR>secname</VAR> : {
    <VAR>contents</VAR>
  }
... }
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<VAR>secname</VAR> is the name of the output section, and <VAR>contents</VAR> a
specification of what goes there--for example, a list of input files or
sections of input files (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC19">Section Placement</A>).  As you might
assume, the whitespace shown is optional.  You do need the colon
<SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and the braces <SAMP>`{}'</SAMP>, however.

</P>
<P>
<VAR>secname</VAR> must meet the constraints of your output format.  In
formats which only support a limited number of sections, such as
<CODE>a.out</CODE>, the name must be one of the names supported by the format
(<CODE>a.out</CODE>, for example, allows only <CODE>.text</CODE>, <CODE>.data</CODE> or
<CODE>.bss</CODE>). If the output format supports any number of sections, but
with numbers and not names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be
supplied as a quoted numeric string.  A section name may consist of any
sequence of characters, but any name which does not conform to the standard
<CODE>ld</CODE> symbol name syntax must be quoted.
See section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC9">Symbol Names</A>.

</P>
<P>
The special <VAR>secname</VAR> <SAMP>`/DISCARD/'</SAMP> may be used to discard input
sections.  Any sections which are assigned to an output section named
<SAMP>`/DISCARD/'</SAMP> are not included in the final link output.

</P>
<P>
The linker will not create output sections which do not have any
contents.  This is for convenience when referring to input sections that

In a section definition, you can specify the contents of an output
section by listing particular input files, by listing particular
input-file sections, or by a combination of the two.  You can also place
arbitrary data in the section, and define symbols relative to the
beginning of the section.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>contents</VAR> of a section definition may include any of the
following kinds of statement.  You can include as many of these as you
like in a single section definition, separated from one another by
whitespace.

You may simply name a particular input file to be placed in the current
output section; <EM>all</EM> sections from that file are placed in the
current section definition.  If the file name has already been mentioned
in another section definition, with an explicit section name list, then
only those sections which have not yet been allocated are used.

To specify a list of particular files by name:

<PRE>
.data : { afile.o bfile.o cfile.o }
</PRE>

The example also illustrates that multiple statements can be included in
the contents of a section definition, since each file name is a separate
statement. 

<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>( <VAR>section</VAR> )</CODE>

<DD>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>( <VAR>section</VAR> <VAR>section</VAR> ... )</CODE>
<DD>
You can name one or more sections from your input files, for
insertion in the current output section.  If you wish to specify a list
of input-file sections inside the parentheses, you may separate the
section names by either commas or whitespace.

Instead of explicitly naming particular input files in a link control
script, you can refer to <EM>all</EM> files from the <CODE>ld</CODE> command
line: use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> instead of a particular file name before the
parenthesized input-file section list.  

If you have already explicitly included some files by name, <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
refers to all <EM>remaining</EM> files--those whose places in the output
file have not yet been defined.

For example, to copy sections <CODE>1</CODE> through <CODE>4</CODE> from an Oasys file
into the <CODE>.text</CODE> section of an <CODE>a.out</CODE> file, and sections <CODE>13</CODE>
and <CODE>14</CODE> into the <CODE>.data</CODE> section:

<PRE>
SECTIONS {
  .text :{
    *("1" "2" "3" "4")

  .data :{
    *("13" "14")
  }

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX260"></A>
<SAMP>`[ <VAR>section</VAR> ... ]'</SAMP> used to be accepted as an alternate way
to specify named sections from all unallocated input files.  Because
some operating systems (VMS) allow brackets in file names, that notation
is no longer supported.

<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR><CODE>( COMMON )</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>*( COMMON )</CODE>
<DD>
Specify where in your output file to place uninitialized data
with this notation.  <CODE>*(COMMON)</CODE> by itself refers to all
uninitialized data from all input files (so far as it is not yet
allocated); <VAR>filename</VAR><CODE>(COMMON)</CODE> refers to uninitialized data
from a particular file.  Both are special cases of the general
mechanisms for specifying where to place input-file sections:
<CODE>ld</CODE> permits you to refer to uninitialized data as if it
were in an input-file section named <CODE>COMMON</CODE>, regardless of the
input file's format.
</DL>

<P>
For example, the following command script arranges the output file into
three consecutive sections, named <CODE>.text</CODE>, <CODE>.data</CODE>, and
<CODE>.bss</CODE>, taking the input for each from the correspondingly named
sections of all the input files:

</P>

<PRE>
SECTIONS { 
  .text : { *(.text) }
  .data : { *(.data) } 
  .bss :  { *(.bss)  *(COMMON) } 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The following example reads all of the sections from file <CODE>all.o</CODE>
and places them at the start of output section <CODE>outputa</CODE> which
starts at location <CODE>0x10000</CODE>. All of section <CODE>.input1</CODE> from
file <CODE>foo.o</CODE> follows immediately, in the same output section.  All
of section <CODE>.input2</CODE> from <CODE>foo.o</CODE> goes into output section
<CODE>outputb</CODE>, followed by section <CODE>.input1</CODE> from <CODE>foo1.o</CODE>.
All of the remaining <CODE>.input1</CODE> and <CODE>.input2</CODE> sections from any

You can force the output section to be loaded at a specified address by
specifying <VAR>start</VAR> immediately following the section name.
<VAR>start</VAR> can be represented as any expression. The following

You can include <CODE>BLOCK()</CODE> specification to advance

an expression.

<A NAME="IDX286"></A>
<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
<DT><CODE>(NOLOAD)</CODE>
<DD>
Use <SAMP>`(NOLOAD)'</SAMP> to prevent a section from being loaded into memory
each time it is accessed.  For example, in the script sample below, the
<CODE>ROM</CODE> segment is addressed at memory location <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> and does not
need to be loaded into each object file:


<PRE>
SECTIONS {
  ROM  0  (NOLOAD)  : { ... }

<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>
<DT><CODE>AT ( <VAR>ldadr</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
The expression <VAR>ldadr</VAR> that follows the <CODE>AT</CODE> keyword specifies
the load address of the section.  The default (if you do not use the
<CODE>AT</CODE> keyword) is to make the load address the same as the
relocation address.  This feature is designed to make it easy to build a
ROM image.  For example, this <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> definition creates two
output sections: one called <SAMP>`.text'</SAMP>, which starts at <CODE>0x1000</CODE>,
and one called <SAMP>`.mdata'</SAMP>, which is loaded at the end of the
<SAMP>`.text'</SAMP> section even though its relocation address is
<CODE>0x2000</CODE>.  The symbol <CODE>_data</CODE> is defined with the value
<CODE>0x2000</CODE>:


<PRE>
SECTIONS
  {
  .text 0x1000 : { *(.text) _etext = . ; }
  .mdata 0x2000 : 
    AT ( ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF ( .text ) )
    { _data = . ; *(.data); _edata = . ;  }
  .bss 0x3000 :
    { _bstart = . ;  *(.bss) *(COMMON) ; _bend = . ;}
}
</PRE>

The run-time initialization code (for C programs, usually <CODE>crt0</CODE>)
for use with a ROM generated this way has to include something like
the following, to copy the initialized data from the ROM image to its runtime
address:


<PRE>
char *src = _etext;
char *dst = _data;

/* ROM has data at end of text; copy it. */
while (dst &#60; _edata) {
  *dst++ = *src++;
}

/* Zero bss */
for (dst = _bstart; dst&#60; _bend; dst++)
  *dst = 0;

The ELF object file format uses <STRONG>program headers</STRONG>, which are read by
the system loader and describe how the program should be loaded into
memory.  These program headers must be set correctly in order to run the
program on a native ELF system.  The linker will create reasonable
program headers by default.  However, in some cases, it is desirable to
specify the program headers more precisely; the <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> command may
be used for this purpose.  When the <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> command is used, the
linker will not generate any program headers itself.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> command is only meaningful when generating an ELF
output file.  It is ignored in other cases.  This manual does not
describe the details of how the system loader interprets program
headers; for more information, see the ELF ABI.  The program headers of
an ELF file may be displayed using the <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> option of the
<CODE>objdump</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
This is the syntax of the <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> command.  The words <CODE>PHDRS</CODE>,

<P>
The <VAR>name</VAR> is used only for reference in the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command
of the linker script.  It does not get put into the output file.

</P>
<P>
Certain program header types describe segments of memory which are
loaded from the file by the system loader.  In the linker script, the
contents of these segments are specified by directing allocated output
sections to be placed in the segment.  To do this, the command
describing the output section in the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command should use
<SAMP>`:<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of the program header
as it appears in the <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> command.  See section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC21">Optional Section Attributes</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is normal for certain sections to appear in more than one segment.
This merely implies that one segment of memory contains another.  This
is specified by repeating <SAMP>`:<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>, using it once for each
program header in which the section is to appear.

</P>
<P>
If a section is placed in one or more segments using <SAMP>`:<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>,
then all subsequent allocated sections which do not specify
<SAMP>`:<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> are placed in the same segments.  This is for
convenience, since generally a whole set of contiguous sections will be
placed in a single segment.  To prevent a section from being assigned to
a segment when it would normally default to one, use <CODE>:NONE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FILEHDR</CODE> and <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> keywords which may appear after the
program header type also indicate contents of the segment of memory.
The <CODE>FILEHDR</CODE> keyword means that the segment should include the ELF
file header.  The <CODE>PHDRS</CODE> keyword means that the segment should
include the ELF program headers themselves.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>type</VAR> may be one of the following.  The numbers indicate the

It is possible to specify that a segment should be loaded at a

expression.  This is identical to the <CODE>AT</CODE> command used in the
<CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="ld_3.html#SEC21">Optional Section Attributes</A>).  Using the <CODE>AT</CODE>
command for a program header overrides any information in the

Normally the segment flags are set based on the sections.  The
<CODE>FLAGS</CODE> keyword may be used to explicitly specify the segment
flags.  The value of <VAR>flags</VAR> must be an integer.  It is used to
set the <CODE>p_flags</CODE> field of the program header.

The linker command language includes a command specifically for
defining the first executable instruction in an output file (its
<STRONG>entry point</STRONG>).  Its argument is a symbol name:

<PRE>
ENTRY(<VAR>symbol</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
Like symbol assignments, the <CODE>ENTRY</CODE> command may be placed either
as an independent command in the command file, or among the section

<P>
<A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<CODE>ENTRY</CODE> is only one of several ways of choosing the entry point.

<UL>
<LI>

the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> <VAR>entry</VAR> command-line option;
<LI>

the <CODE>ENTRY(<VAR>symbol</VAR>)</CODE> command in a linker control script;
<LI>

the value of the symbol <CODE>start</CODE>, if present;
<LI>

the address of the first byte of the <CODE>.text</CODE> section, if present;
<LI>

The address <CODE>0</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For example, you can use these rules to generate an entry point with an
assignment statement: if no symbol <CODE>start</CODE> is defined within your
input files, you can simply define it, assigning it an appropriate
value---

</P>

<PRE>
start = 0x2020;

name.  For these object file formats, the <CODE>CONSTRUCTORS</CODE> command
tells the linker where this information should be placed.  The
<CODE>CONSTRUCTORS</CODE> command is ignored for other object file formats.

The symbol <CODE>__CTOR_LIST__</CODE> marks the start of the global
constructors, and the symbol <CODE>__DTOR_LIST</CODE> marks the end.  The
first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address
of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word.  The
compiler must arrange to actually run the code.  For these object file
formats GNU C++ calls constructors from a subroutine <CODE>__main</CODE>;
a call to <CODE>__main</CODE> is automatically inserted into the startup code
for <CODE>main</CODE>.  GNU C++ runs destructors either by using
<CODE>atexit</CODE>, or directly from the function <CODE>exit</CODE>.

For object file formats such as <CODE>COFF</CODE> or <CODE>ELF</CODE> which support
multiple sections, GNU C++ will normally arrange to put the
addresses of global constructors and destructors into the <CODE>.ctors</CODE>
and <CODE>.dtors</CODE> sections.  Placing the following sequence into your
linker script will build the sort of table which the GNU C++
runtime code expects to see.


<PRE>
      __CTOR_LIST__ = .;
      LONG((__CTOR_END__ - __CTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)
      *(.ctors)
      LONG(0)
      __CTOR_END__ = .;
      __DTOR_LIST__ = .;
      LONG((__DTOR_END__ - __DTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)
      *(.dtors)
      LONG(0)
      __DTOR_END__ = .;
</PRE>

Normally the compiler and linker will handle these issues automatically,
and you will not need to concern yourself with them.  However, you may
need to consider this if you are using C++ and writing your own linker
scripts.

<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>NOFLOAT</CODE>
<DD>
These keywords were used in some older linkers to request a particular
math subroutine library.  <CODE>ld</CODE> doesn't use the keywords, assuming
instead that any necessary subroutines are in libraries specified using
the general mechanisms for linking to archives; but to permit the use of
scripts that were written for the older linkers, the keywords
<CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and <CODE>NOFLOAT</CODE> are accepted and ignored.

<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<DT><CODE>FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION</CODE>
<DD>
This command has the same effect as the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> command-line option:
to make <CODE>ld</CODE> assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable
output file is specified (<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>).

<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<DT><CODE>INPUT ( <VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>file</VAR>, ... )</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>INPUT ( <VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>file</VAR> ... )</CODE>
<DD>
Use this command to include binary input files in the link, without
including them in a particular section definition.  
Specify the full name for each <VAR>file</VAR>, including <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> if
required.

<CODE>ld</CODE> searches for each <VAR>file</VAR> through the archive-library
search path, just as for files you specify on the command line.
See the description of <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> in section <A HREF="ld_2.html#SEC3">Command Line Options</A>.

If you use <SAMP>`-l<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, <CODE>ld</CODE> will transform the name to
<CODE>lib<VAR>file</VAR>.a</CODE> as with the command line argument <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<DT><CODE>GROUP ( <VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>file</VAR>, ... )</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>GROUP ( <VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>file</VAR> ... )</CODE>
<DD>
This command is like <CODE>INPUT</CODE>, except that the named files should
all be archives, and they are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  See the description of <SAMP>`-('</SAMP> in
section <A HREF="ld_2.html#SEC3">Command Line Options</A>.

<A NAME="IDX319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTPUT ( <VAR>filename</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
Use this command to name the link output file <VAR>filename</VAR>.  The
effect of <CODE>OUTPUT(<VAR>filename</VAR>)</CODE> is identical to the effect of
<SAMP>`-o <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP>, which overrides it.  You can use this
command to supply a default output-file name other than <CODE>a.out</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTPUT_ARCH ( <VAR>bfdname</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
Specify a particular output machine architecture, with one of the names
used by the BFD back-end routines (see section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC28">BFD</A>).  This command is often
unnecessary; the architecture is most often set implicitly by either the
system BFD configuration or as a side effect of the <CODE>OUTPUT_FORMAT</CODE>
command.

<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTPUT_FORMAT ( <VAR>bfdname</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
When <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured to support multiple object code formats,
you can use this command to specify a particular output format.
<VAR>bfdname</VAR> is one of the names used by the BFD back-end routines
(see section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC28">BFD</A>).  The effect is identical to the effect of the
<SAMP>`-oformat'</SAMP> command-line option.  This selection affects only
the output file; the related command <CODE>TARGET</CODE> affects primarily
input files.

<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<DT><CODE>SEARCH_DIR ( <VAR>path</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
Add <VAR>path</VAR> to the list of paths where <CODE>ld</CODE> looks for
archive libraries.  <CODE>SEARCH_DIR(<VAR>path</VAR>)</CODE> has the same
effect as <SAMP>`-L<VAR>path</VAR>'</SAMP> on the command line.

<A NAME="IDX328"></A>
<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<DT><CODE>STARTUP ( <VAR>filename</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
Ensure that <VAR>filename</VAR> is the first input file used in the link
process. 

<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET ( <VAR>format</VAR> )</CODE>
<DD>
When <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured to support multiple object code formats,
you can use this command to change the input-file object code format
(like the command-line option <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> or its synonym <SAMP>`-format'</SAMP>).
The argument <VAR>format</VAR> is one of the strings used by BFD to name
binary formats.  If <CODE>TARGET</CODE> is specified but <CODE>OUTPUT_FORMAT</CODE>
is not, the last <CODE>TARGET</CODE> argument is also used as the default
format for the <CODE>ld</CODE> output file.  See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC28">BFD</A>.

<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
If you don't use the <CODE>TARGET</CODE> command, <CODE>ld</CODE> uses the value of
the environment variable <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>, if available, to select the
output file format.  If that variable is also absent, <CODE>ld</CODE> uses
the default format configured for your machine in the BFD libraries.

<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="binutils_toc.html#TOC14">Selecting the target system</A></H1>

<P>
You can specify three aspects of the target system to the GNU
binary file utilities, each in several ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

the target

<LI>

the architecture

<LI>

the linker emulation (which applies to the linker only)
</UL>

<P>
In the following summaries, the lists of ways to specify values are in
order of decreasing precedence.  The ways listed first override those
listed later.

</P>
<P>
The commands to list valid values only list the values for which the
programs you are running were configured.  If they were configured with
<SAMP>`--enable-targets=all'</SAMP>, the commands list most of the available
values, but a few are left out; not all targets can be configured in at
once because some of them can only be configured <STRONG>native</STRONG> (on hosts
with the same type as the target system).

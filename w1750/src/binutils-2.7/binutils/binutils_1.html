<P>
The GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> program creates, modifies, and extracts from
archives.  An <STRONG>archive</STRONG> is a single file holding a collection of
other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve
the original individual files (called <STRONG>members</STRONG> of the archive).

</P>
<P>
The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and
group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
extraction.  

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> can maintain archives whose members have names of any
length; however, depending on how <CODE>ar</CODE> is configured on your
system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility
with archive formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the
limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
characters (typical of formats related to coff).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<CODE>ar</CODE> is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
are most often used as <STRONG>libraries</STRONG> holding commonly needed
subroutines.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<CODE>ar</CODE> creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable
object modules in the archive when you specify the modifier <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>.
Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever <CODE>ar</CODE>
makes a change to its contents (save for the <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> update operation).
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.

</P>
<P>
You may use <SAMP>`nm -s'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`nm --print-armap'</SAMP> to list this index
table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of <CODE>ar</CODE> called
<CODE>ranlib</CODE> can be used to add just the table.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> is designed to be compatible with two different
facilities.  You can control its activity using command-line options,
like the different varieties of <CODE>ar</CODE> on Unix systems; or, if you
specify the single command-line option <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP>, you can control it
with a script supplied via standard input, like the MRI "librarian"
program.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="binutils_toc.html#TOC2">Controlling <CODE>ar</CODE> on the command line</A></H2>


<PRE>
m1750-coff-ar [-]<VAR>p</VAR>[<VAR>mod</VAR> [<VAR>relpos</VAR>]] <VAR>archive</VAR> [<VAR>member</VAR>...]
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
When you use <CODE>ar</CODE> in the Unix style, <CODE>ar</CODE> insists on at least two
arguments to execute: one keyletter specifying the <EM>operation</EM>
(optionally accompanied by other keyletters specifying
<EM>modifiers</EM>), and the archive name to act on.

</P>
<P>
Most operations can also accept further <VAR>member</VAR> arguments,
specifying particular files to operate on.

</P>
<P>
GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> allows you to mix the operation code <VAR>p</VAR> and modifier
flags <VAR>mod</VAR> in any order, within the first command-line argument.

</P>
<P>
If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
The <VAR>p</VAR> keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be
any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>d</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<EM>Delete</EM> modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
be deleted as <VAR>member</VAR>...; the archive is untouched if you
specify no files to delete.

If you specify the <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> modifier, <CODE>ar</CODE> lists each module
as it is deleted.

<DT><CODE>m</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
Use this operation to <EM>move</EM> members in an archive.

The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in more
than one member.  

If no modifiers are used with <CODE>m</CODE>, any members you name in the
<VAR>member</VAR> arguments are moved to the <EM>end</EM> of the archive;
you can use the <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> modifiers to move them to a
specified place instead.

<DT><CODE>p</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<EM>Print</EM> the specified members of the archive, to the standard
output file.  If the <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> modifier is specified, show the member
name before copying its contents to standard output.

If you specify no <VAR>member</VAR> arguments, all the files in the archive are
printed.

<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<EM>Quick append</EM>; add the files <VAR>member</VAR>... to the end of
<VAR>archive</VAR>, without checking for replacement.

The modifiers <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> do <EM>not</EM> affect this
operation; new members are always placed at the end of the archive.

The modifier <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> makes <CODE>ar</CODE> list each file as it is appended.

Since the point of this operation is speed, the archive's symbol table
index is not updated, even if it already existed; you can use <SAMP>`ar s'</SAMP> or
<CODE>ranlib</CODE> explicitly to update the symbol table index.

<DT><CODE>r</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
Insert the files <VAR>member</VAR>... into <VAR>archive</VAR> (with
<EM>replacement</EM>). This operation differs from <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> in that any
previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being
added.

If one of the files named in <VAR>member</VAR>... does not exist, <CODE>ar</CODE>
displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members
of the archive matching that name.

By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may
use one of the modifiers <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> to request
placement relative to some existing member.

The modifier <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> used with this operation elicits a line of
output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`r'</SAMP> to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
deleted) or replaced.

<DT><CODE>t</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
Display a <EM>table</EM> listing the contents of <VAR>archive</VAR>, or those
of the files listed in <VAR>member</VAR>... that are present in the
archive.  Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to
see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
request that by also specifying the <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> modifier.

If you do not specify a <VAR>member</VAR>, all files in the archive
are listed.

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
If there is more than one file with the same name (say, <SAMP>`fie'</SAMP>) in
an archive (say <SAMP>`b.a'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`ar t b.a fie'</SAMP> lists only the
first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
listing--in our example, <SAMP>`ar t b.a'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>x</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<EM>Extract</EM> members (named <VAR>member</VAR>) from the archive.  You can
use the <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> modifier with this operation, to request that
<CODE>ar</CODE> list each name as it extracts it.

If you do not specify a <VAR>member</VAR>, all files in the archive
are extracted.

</DL>

<P>
A number of modifiers (<VAR>mod</VAR>) may immediately follow the <VAR>p</VAR>
keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
Add new files <EM>after</EM> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <VAR>relpos</VAR> argument, before the
<VAR>archive</VAR> specification.

<DT><CODE>b</CODE>
<DD>
Add new files <EM>before</EM> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <VAR>relpos</VAR> argument, before the
<VAR>archive</VAR> specification.  (same as <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>).

<DT><CODE>c</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<EM>Create</EM> the archive.  The specified <VAR>archive</VAR> is always
created if it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by
using this modifier.

<DT><CODE>f</CODE>
<DD>
Truncate names in the archive.  GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> will normally permit file
names of any length.  This will cause it to create archives which are
not compatible with the native <CODE>ar</CODE> program on some systems.  If
this is a concern, the <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> modifier may be used to truncate file
names when putting them in the archive.

<DT><CODE>i</CODE>
<DD>
Insert new files <EM>before</EM> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <VAR>relpos</VAR> argument, before the
<VAR>archive</VAR> specification.  (same as <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>).

<DT><CODE>l</CODE>
<DD>
This modifier is accepted but not used.

<DT><CODE>o</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
Preserve the <EM>original</EM> dates of members when extracting them.  If
you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
are stamped with the time of extraction.

<DT><CODE>s</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use this modifier
flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running <SAMP>`ar s'</SAMP> on an
archive is equivalent to running <SAMP>`ranlib'</SAMP> on it.

<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
Normally, <SAMP>`ar r'</SAMP>... inserts all files
listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert <EM>only</EM> those
of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same
names, use this modifier.  The <SAMP>`u'</SAMP> modifier is allowed only for the
operation <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> (replace).  In particular, the combination <SAMP>`qu'</SAMP> is
not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed
advantage from the operation <SAMP>`q'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>v</CODE>
<DD>
This modifier requests the <EM>verbose</EM> version of an operation.  Many
operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
when the modifier <SAMP>`v'</SAMP> is appended.

<DT><CODE>V</CODE>
<DD>
This modifier shows the version number of <CODE>ar</CODE>.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="binutils_toc.html#TOC3">Controlling <CODE>ar</CODE> with a script</A></H2>


<PRE>
m1750-coff-ar -M [ &#60;<VAR>script</VAR> ]
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
If you use the single command-line option <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> with <CODE>ar</CODE>, you
can control its operation with a rudimentary command language.  This
form of <CODE>ar</CODE> operates interactively if standard input is coming
directly from a terminal.  During interactive use, <CODE>ar</CODE> prompts for
input (the prompt is <SAMP>`AR &#62;'</SAMP>), and continues executing even after
errors.  If you redirect standard input to a script file, no prompts are
issued, and <CODE>ar</CODE> abandons execution (with a nonzero exit code)
on any error.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>ar</CODE> command language is <EM>not</EM> designed to be equivalent
to the command-line options; in fact, it provides somewhat less control
over archives.  The only purpose of the command language is to ease the
transition to GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> for developers who already have scripts
written for the MRI "librarian" program.

</P>
<P>
The syntax for the <CODE>ar</CODE> command language is straightforward:

<UL>
<LI>

commands are recognized in upper or lower case; for example, <CODE>LIST</CODE>
is the same as <CODE>list</CODE>.  In the following descriptions, commands are
shown in upper case for clarity.

<LI>

a single command may appear on each line; it is the first word on the
line.

<LI>

empty lines are allowed, and have no effect.

<LI>

comments are allowed; text after either of the characters <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> is ignored.

<LI>

Whenever you use a list of names as part of the argument to an <CODE>ar</CODE>
command, you can separate the individual names with either commas or
blanks.  Commas are shown in the explanations below, for clarity.

<LI>

<SAMP>`+'</SAMP> is used as a line continuation character; if <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> appears
at the end of a line, the text on the following line is considered part
of the current command.
</UL>

<P>
Here are the commands you can use in <CODE>ar</CODE> scripts, or when using
<CODE>ar</CODE> interactively.  Three of them have special significance:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE> specify a <STRONG>current archive</STRONG>, which is
a temporary file required for most of the other commands.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SAVE</CODE> commits the changes so far specified by the script.  Prior
to <CODE>SAVE</CODE>, commands affect only the temporary copy of the current
archive.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ADDLIB <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ADDLIB <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Add all the contents of <VAR>archive</VAR> (or, if specified, each named
<VAR>module</VAR> from <VAR>archive</VAR>) to the current archive.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ADDMOD <VAR>member</VAR>, <VAR>member</VAR>, ... <VAR>member</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Add each named <VAR>member</VAR> as a module in the current archive.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>CLEAR</CODE>
<DD>
Discard the contents of the current archive, cancelling the effect of
any operations since the last <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.  May be executed (with no
effect) even if  no current archive is specified.

<DT><CODE>CREATE <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Creates an archive, and makes it the current archive (required for many
other commands).  The new archive is created with a temporary name; it
is not actually saved as <VAR>archive</VAR> until you use <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.
You can overwrite existing archives; similarly, the contents of any
existing file named <VAR>archive</VAR> will not be destroyed until <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>DELETE <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Delete each listed <VAR>module</VAR> from the current archive; equivalent to
<SAMP>`ar -d <VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR> ... <VAR>module</VAR>'</SAMP>.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>DIRECTORY <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DIRECTORY <VAR>archive</VAR> (<VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR>) <VAR>outputfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
List each named <VAR>module</VAR> present in <VAR>archive</VAR>.  The separate
command <CODE>VERBOSE</CODE> specifies the form of the output: when verbose
output is off, output is like that of <SAMP>`ar -t <VAR>archive</VAR>
<VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.  When verbose output is on, the listing is like
<SAMP>`ar -tv <VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.

Output normally goes to the standard output stream; however, if you
specify <VAR>outputfile</VAR> as a final argument, <CODE>ar</CODE> directs the
output to that file.

<DT><CODE>END</CODE>
<DD>
Exit from <CODE>ar</CODE>, with a <CODE>0</CODE> exit code to indicate successful
completion.  This command does not save the output file; if you have
changed the current archive since the last <CODE>SAVE</CODE> command, those
changes are lost.

<DT><CODE>EXTRACT <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Extract each named <VAR>module</VAR> from the current archive, writing them
into the current directory as separate files.  Equivalent to <SAMP>`ar -x
<VAR>archive</VAR> <VAR>module</VAR>...'</SAMP>.

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>LIST</CODE>
<DD>
Display full contents of the current archive, in "verbose" style
regardless of the state of <CODE>VERBOSE</CODE>.  The effect is like <SAMP>`ar
tv <VAR>archive</VAR>'</SAMP>).  (This single command is a GNU <CODE>ld</CODE>
enhancement, rather than present for MRI compatibility.)

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>OPEN <VAR>archive</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Opens an existing archive for use as the current archive (required for
many other commands).  Any changes as the result of subsequent commands
will not actually affect <VAR>archive</VAR> until you next use <CODE>SAVE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>REPLACE <VAR>module</VAR>, <VAR>module</VAR>, ... <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
In the current archive, replace each existing <VAR>module</VAR> (named in
the <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> arguments) from files in the current working directory.
To execute this command without errors, both the file, and the module in
the current archive, must exist. 

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>VERBOSE</CODE>
<DD>
Toggle an internal flag governing the output from <CODE>DIRECTORY</CODE>.
When the flag is on, <CODE>DIRECTORY</CODE> output matches output from
<SAMP>`ar -tv '</SAMP>....

<DT><CODE>SAVE</CODE>
<DD>
Commit your changes to the current archive, and actually save it as a
file with the name specified in the last <CODE>CREATE</CODE> or <CODE>OPEN</CODE>
command. 

Requires prior use of <CODE>OPEN</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE</CODE>.

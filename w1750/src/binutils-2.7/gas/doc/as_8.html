The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> runs.  Floating point representations
vary as well, and <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> often supports a few additional
directives or command-line options for compatibility with other
assemblers on a particular platform.  Finally, some versions of
<CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> support special pseudo-instructions for branch
optimization.

<P>
This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

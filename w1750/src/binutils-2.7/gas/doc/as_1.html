<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a[dhlns]</CODE>
<DD>
Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-ad</CODE>
<DD>
omit debugging directives

<DT><CODE>-ah</CODE>
<DD>
include high-level source

<DT><CODE>-al</CODE>
<DD>
include assembly

<DT><CODE>-an</CODE>
<DD>
omit forms processing

<DT><CODE>-as</CODE>
<DD>
include symbols

<DT><CODE>=file</CODE>
<DD>
set the name of the listing file
</DL>

You may combine these options; for example, use <SAMP>`-aln'</SAMP> for assembly
listing without forms processing.  The <SAMP>`=file'</SAMP> option, if used, must be
the last one.  By itself, <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> defaults to <SAMP>`-ahls'</SAMP>---that is, all
listings turned on.

<DT><CODE>-D</CODE>
<DD>
Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with calls to
other assemblers.

<DT><CODE>--defsym <VAR>sym</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Define the symbol <VAR>sym</VAR> to be <VAR>value</VAR> before assembling the input file.
<VAR>value</VAR> must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP>
indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> indicates an octal value.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
"fast"---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
compiler output).

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Add directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the search list for <CODE>.include</CODE> directives.

<DT><CODE>-J</CODE>
<DD>
Don't warn about signed overflow.

<DT><CODE>-K</CODE>
<DD>
Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>
Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols, starting with <SAMP>`L'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>objfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Name the object-file output from <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> <VAR>objfile</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Fold the data section into the text section.

<DT><CODE>--statistics</CODE>
<DD>
Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used by
assembly.

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-version</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC2">Structure of this Manual</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use
GNU <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including
notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that
<CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> understands; and of course how to invoke <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
On the other hand, this manual is <EM>not</EM> intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do <EM>not</EM> describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.
You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC3">m1750-coff-as, the GNU Assembler</A></H2>

<P>
GNU <CODE>as</CODE> is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
<STRONG>pseudo-ops</STRONG>) and assembler syntax.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> is primarily intended to assemble the output of the
GNU C compiler <CODE>m1750-coff-gcc</CODE> for use by the linker
<CODE>m1750-coff-ld</CODE>.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>
assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.

</P>
<P>
Unlike older assemblers, <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
<KBD>.org</KBD> directive (see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC107"><CODE>.org <VAR>new-lc</CODE> , <VAR>fill</VAR></VAR></A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC4">Object File Formats</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  See section <A HREF="as_5.html#SEC48">Symbol Attributes</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC5">Command Line</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
After the program name <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>, the command line may contain
options and file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be
before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<TT>`--'</TT> (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> to assemble.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
Except for <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> any command line argument that begins with a
hyphen (<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>) is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
<CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
option is a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> followed by one or more letters; the case of
the letter is important.   All options are optional.

</P>
<P>
Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
m1750-coff-as -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
m1750-coff-as -omy-object-file.o mumble.s
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC6">Input Files</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
We use the phrase <STRONG>source program</STRONG>, abbreviated <STRONG>source</STRONG>, to
describe the program input to one run of <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>.  The program may
be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into files
doesn't change the meaning of the source.

</P>
<P>
The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files, in the
order specified.

</P>
<P>
Each time you run <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

</P>
<P>
You give <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> a command line that has zero or more input file
names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A
command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning
is taken to be an input file name.

</P>
<P>
If you give <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type <KBD>ctl-D</KBD> to tell <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> there is no more program
to assemble.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.

</P>
<P>
If the source is empty, <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> produces a small, empty object
file.

</P>

<H3>Filenames and Line-numbers</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a line
number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  See section <A HREF="as_1.html#SEC8">Error and Warning Messages</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Physical files</STRONG> are those files named in the command line given
to <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Logical files</STRONG> are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE>
source is itself synthesized from other files.
See section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC69"><CODE>.app-file <VAR>string</CODE></VAR></A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC7">Output (Object) File</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
Every time you run <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> it produces an output file, which is
your assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file
is the object file.  Its default name is
<CODE>a.out</CODE>.
<CODE>b.out</CODE> when <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> is configured for the Intel 80960.
You can give it another name by using the <CODE>-o</CODE> option.  Conventionally,
object file names end with <TT>`.o'</TT>.  The default name is used for historical
reasons: older assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs
directly into a runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently
possible, but it can be done for the <CODE>a.out</CODE> format.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
The object file is meant for input to the linker <CODE>m1750-coff-ld</CODE>.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help <CODE>m1750-coff-ld</CODE> integrate
the assembled program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic
information for the debugger.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC8">Error and Warning Messages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler
runs <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that <CODE>m1750-coff-as</CODE> could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
Warning messages have the format

</P>

<PRE>
file_name:<B>NNN</B>:Warning Message Text
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
(where <B>NNN</B> is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC69"><CODE>.app-file <VAR>string</CODE></VAR></A>) it is used for the filename,
otherwise the name of the current input file is used.  If a logical line
number was given
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC98"><CODE>.line <VAR>line-number</CODE></VAR></A>)
then it is used to calculate the number printed,
otherwise the actual line in the current source file is printed.  The
message text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix
tradition).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
Error messages have the format

<PRE>
file_name:<B>NNN</B>:FATAL:Error Message Text
</PRE>

<P>
The file name and line number are derived as for warning
messages.  The actual message text may be rather less explanatory
because many of them aren't supposed to happen.
